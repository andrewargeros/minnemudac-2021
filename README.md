This repo contains all of the code, data, and output from our entry in the 2021 [MinneMUDAC Data Science Competition](https://minneanalytics.org/minnemudac/) sponsored by Minneanalytics

## The Problem

This year's competition focused on predicting the outcome of the [2021 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament), or March Madness.

## The Data

The majority of the data used stems from the [2021 Kaggle March Madness Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ncaam-march-mania-2021/data). The data are assembled into 20 `.csv` files, stored in the `\Data` folder.

These files can be downloaded using the Kaggle API: 

```
kaggle competitions download -c ncaam-march-mania-2021 -p {PATH TO YOUR DIRECTORY}
```
